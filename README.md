We segmented and channel stripped the labeled dataset provided by Kunhao Yuan. In addition to NIR being 256 * 256, each patch size is 512 * 512, corresponding to RGB, SWIR images and labels.

The segmented dataset is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/17aI4eSFbtp1sh5V57iM36cOa2AM4Rw5n/view?usp=sharing

And the original labeled dataset provided by Kunhao Yuan is available at https://github.com/SCoulY/Sentinel-2-Water-Segmentation
